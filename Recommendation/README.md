This dataset describes a set of interactions between website users and website advertisements. Users can see, click, and convert on advertisements.

I have a publication I am currently working on that uses this dataset.

There are 5 tables:
(1) user_base         - The set of users. 
(2) offer_base        - The set of advertisements. 
(3) user_information  - The set of user attributes like gender, age, etc... 
(4) offer_information - The set of advertisement attributes like ad category, time to complete, etc... 
(5) website_activity  - The set of interactions between the users and offers.
