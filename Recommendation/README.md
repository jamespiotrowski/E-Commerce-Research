This dataset describes a set of interactions between website users and website advertisements. Users can see, click, and convert on advertisements.

I have a publication I am currently working on that uses this dataset.

**There are 3 tables:**
| File Name | Table Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| user_information_base.txt | user_information | The set of users and their attributes like gender, age, etc... | 
| offer_information_base.txt | offer_information | The set of advertisements and their attributes like ad category, time to complete, etc... |
| website_activity_base.txt | website_activity | The set of interactions between the users and offers. |
