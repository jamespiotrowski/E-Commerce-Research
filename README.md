# E-Commerce-Research
**A Repository for my E-Commerce Research**

*What will you find here?* <br>
This repository will house datasets I use for my machine learning e-commerce research. Any machine learning solutions I write may be uploaded to this repository given that I can. Much of the code I write is implemented for a private organization, thus the code is not mine to publish. However, I will always publish the datasets that I use and the publications describing the work. <br>
