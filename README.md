# E-Commerce-Research
**A Repository for my E-Commerce Research** <br>
<ins>*What is this?* </ins><br>
My name is James Piotrowski and I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science for The University of Nevada Las Vegas. My disseration aims to explore machine learning solutions for E-Commerce business. <br>

All work I complete for this disseration will be found in this repository with a single exception. I work as a Machine Learning Specialist for a private organization and much of the work I will do will be property of this organization. All datasets I use will be published here so that others may validate my results, though most of the code I write will not be published here. There may be some exception to this, especially if I can find an acceptable dataset for my research outside of my organization. <br>



*Projects* <br>
