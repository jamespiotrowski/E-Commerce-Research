# E-Commerce-Research
**A Repository for my E-Commerce Research**
<ins>*What is this?* </ins><br>
My name is James Piotrowski and I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science for The University of Nevada Las Vegas. My disseration aims to explore machine learning solutions for E-Commerce business. All work I complete for this disseration will be found in this repository with a single exception. I work as a Machine Learning Specialist for a private organization and much of the work I will do will be property of this organization. All datasets I use will be published here so that others may validate my results, though most of the code I write will not be published here. There may be some exception to this, especially if I can find an acceptable dataset for my research outside of my organization. <br>

<ins>*What will you find here?* </ins><br>
This repository will house datasets I use for my machine learning e-commerce research. Any machine learning solutions I write may be uploaded to this repository given that I can. Much of the code I write is implemented for a private organization, thus the code is not mine to publish. However, I will always publish the datasets that I use and the publications describing the work. <br>
